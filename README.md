**CHAPTER I: INTRODUCTION**

1.1 **Introduction**  
Agro Culture is a system designed to help farmers plan, monitor, and analyze their production activities. It allows farmers to manage operations through a single platform, organizing all relevant data in one place. This system aims to enhance collaboration between growers and buyers, inspiring farmers to produce quality goods while encouraging buyers to consume fresh products. The Agro Culture System aims to strengthen connections among farmers and buyers, ensuring the provision of quality food and increasing the efficiency of agricultural processes.

1.3 **Objectives of the Project**  
The specific objectives of the project include:
- Providing qualitative foods to buyers.
- Implementing an automated online agro culture system.
- Inspiring farmers to produce quality goods for supply to buyers.
- Promoting an eco-friendly farming system.

1.4 **Scope of the Project**  
The project focuses on studying existing agro culture systems to ensure that people receive quality fresh goods. The expected outcomes include:
- Reducing effort and labor intensity by streamlining the creation, management, and running of a secure quality food supply.
- Increasing the number of buyers due to improved convenience in purchasing goods.
- Facilitating easy management of operations.

1.5 **Methodology/Procedure**  
For project development, the database was designed using PHPMYADMIN, the back end was coded in basic PHP, and the front end utilized the same basic PHP codes. Software methodologies focus on the process of creating software, emphasizing organizational aspects rather than purely technical details.

1.7 **Project Framework**  
A framework provides a standardized set of concepts, practices, and criteria to address common problems, allowing developers to avoid redundant work by reusing existing code. This approach saves time and effort during the development process.

1.8 **Data and Information**  
Data collection is crucial for project success and timely completion. The project data includes client contact information, feedback, and complaints, all stored in a database. Access to this information is restricted to administrators for safety.

1.9 **Primary Source of Data**  
Primary data are firsthand observations collected through day-to-day activities, supervisor instructions, queries, and discussions with staff. This includes:
- Observations of the working environment.
- Informal discussions and interactions with library department staff.

1.10 **Secondary Source of Data**  
Secondary data were collected to gather accurate and factual information. Major sources include:
- Annual reports from the concerned organization.
- Related websites.

1.11 **Tools Used**  
- **XAMPP**: 
  - **Apache**: An open-source Java Servlet Container developed by the Apache Software Foundation.
  - **MySQL Server**: Efficiently handles large databases and provides a multi-threaded SQL server.
- **Sublime Text 3.1.1**: A sophisticated text editor for code, markup, and prose.
- **Web Browsers**: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, and Internet Explorer.
- **GitHub**: A web-based hosting service for version control using Git, primarily for code management.

1.12 **Testing**  
Testing evaluates software against user requirements and system specifications, identifying defects and assessing overall quality.

1.12.1 **Unit Testing**  
Unit testing focuses on specific functions and areas of the code, verifying that all functions operate as expected.

1.12.2 **Integration Testing**  
Integration testing combines previously tested units into a component, testing the interface between them to identify any integration issues.

1.12.3 **System Testing**  
System testing evaluates the entire system's behavior based on the project's scope, including risk-based tests and specifications, ensuring the system meets its objectives.

**CHAPTER II: TASK AND ACTIVITIES PERFORMED**

2.1 **System Analysis**  
System Analysis involves a detailed study of the operations performed by the system and their relationships. Key questions include identifying existing problems and potential solutions. Analysis begins when a user or manager reviews the existing system. Common tools used include Data Flow Diagrams. The success of the system largely depends on how clearly the problems are defined and investigated.

2.3 **Problem Analysis**  
This section addresses issues related to accessing user and candidate information. The project focuses on simple requirements regarding user and candidate data. Key problems in designing and developing this project include:
- Issues with running XAMPP.
- Debugging errors during development.
- Demonstrating relationships between entities.
- Minor errors with database tables.

2.4 **Feasibility Analysis**  
Feasibility analysis determines if the identified problems are worth solving. It evaluates the proposed project's technical, economic, and operational feasibility.

2.4.1 **Economical Analysis**  
Economic feasibility assesses the benefits and costs associated with the project, often through cost-benefit analysis, considering both tangible and intangible benefits.

2.4.2 **Software Analysis**  
Software analysis evaluates the time required to develop the web application, research costs, and implementation costs associated with server space.

2.4.3 **Data Conversion**  
Data conversion costs include backing up existing software databases to prevent loss during the implementation of a new web application.

2.4.4 **Operational Feasibility**  
The system is operationally feasible, as normal users with basic computer skills can operate it without extensive training.

2.5 **Use Case Diagram**  
The Use Case Diagram identifies and organizes system requirements, detailing how users interact with the system to achieve specific goals.

2.6 **Sequence Diagram**  
A Sequence Diagram describes how objects interact over time, focusing on processes and messages exchanged to perform functions.

2.7 **Activity Diagram**  
The Activity Diagram outlines the control flow of the system, indicating sequential, concurrent, or branched processes.

2.9 **ER Diagram**  
The ER Diagram illustrates relationships between entity sets in the database, providing a logical structure of the data.

2.10 **Gantt Chart**  
The Gantt Chart illustrates the project timeline, showing expected completion dates and helping assess resource requirements.

2.12 **Findings**  
After extensive testing and debugging, the project is ready for deployment, aiming to achieve its goals of facilitating ease in agricultural operations.

2.12.1 **Application’s Output**  
- **Backend**: Farmer/Buyer login interface.
- **Frontend**: Member login interface, home page, and logout functionality.
